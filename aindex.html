            <p>The business named “From Love, With Love” was from the students of St. Joseph College of 
                Cavite, Inc. specifically the Grade 12 STEM students from St. Martin De Porres . The 
                business was formed with the love and passion of students to learn and improve. Through 
                hard work and dedication every step has become meaningful and the paths clearly became to 
                success. From the title itself “Love”, products are made with affection where connections 
                are served among customers. Along with the eagerness, passion, and innovativeness of the 
                business owners, ordinary items were turned into sentimental ones.</p>
